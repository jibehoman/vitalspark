Listen to BA messages Meeting 24 June Austin TX:

"AUREA UPDATES"

"Strategic product direction & roadmap (Neil’s views)
- Future releases planned, backwards compatibility
- use of BPM and process engines, where next for Sonic? 
- integration of business logic processing capability (OSGI or similar)
- data and the semantic bus, what is going on?
- closer integration of the toolset, what progress to date?"

We can talk about "where next for Sonic?", "and semantic bus and Sonic". Re "Toolset": in part needs to hear from us that 
we are going all out for ease-of-use Web UIs. This DOES NOT MEAN WE CONVERT Sonic Management Console to Web!!!!
Keep SMC as "regedit for Sonic"; Web UI MUST radically cut down choices that are irrelevant(how many MF components per
container etc).  
 
 
 "2. What are other Aurea customers doing"
 
 - Disney, Cerner? We MUST internally view BA as strategic for our use cases - there are compelling drivers for both of us
 to make this work(see later) 
 
"3. How much of a focus for Aurea is REST? 
- how do we create an agile platform for mobile etc?
- Sonic seen as too complex
- Time to market slow
- How do we maintain separation of concerns? 
Should we go for multiple domains for example?
- currently the AI exposed URLs are not suitable for REST and we need to add an Apache re-write layer – would be good
if we could control the exposed AI URL and remove the re-write complexity.  There is a CR on this"

 
 "REST, Agile, mobile" - lot's of stuff here, we need to find out these answers with priorities: 
 
 Do you mean:
 
 - UIs tools/builders for mobile?(Savvion more likely has)
 - Transport mechanics REST/JSON/AJAX
 - Deeper definition of connection between REST in the pure architectural sense, and ESB.
   - For example, what is a RESTful itinerary?
   - Is there a take-away for HATEOS(Hytertext As the Engine of State Transfer) and ESB?
   - Are we looking for a association of URLs to itineraries(one such association might be for example: itinerary = REST resource
     hierarchy level) 
   - Is URL re-write an issue? (and I mean embedded-references)?
 - Can BA share us their use cases here?   
 - Is there something more compelling? e.g. mobile = GPS/or wireless location awareness, music, photos. 
 - Do we want devices to post attachments, photos and does itinerary need special accommodations for this?
 - Follow on, what are the the MIME multi-part constraints of itinerary - deep nested, recursive is not there currently for example  
 - Does BA want to capitalize on location awareness, and, for example, dynamically rewrite application logic
   based on it. Any compelling use cases from BA will help here. Is Sonic Dynamic Itinerary capability
   a thing we should go after(and we're are NOT that far away from this - BA should be told that ESB itinerary engine was
   rewritten in 8.0 and, internally, dynamic routing slips are now much more programmable)? 
   IMHO, if we can get use cases(and by the very nature of there business, BA has to be prime candidate)
   dynamic routing slip gives SonicESB free and clear differentiation from everything else. If this can get play we need to
   look at protecting out IP here(patents etc).
    
 
  
  - "Sonic complex, time to market long"
  
  Answer:  Repository will help on both fronts. We have to make more stuff readily available. Until repository that could only HAVE 
  come OOB or via the field. 
  
  For example: on the REST front - a universal REST access service(currently prototyped) makes EVERY process REST accessible. 
  Without that, for sure, Sonic Connect or AI enablement IS complex.

"- How do we maintain separation of concerns? 
Should we go for multiple domains for example?"

  Question: What do you mean? Is this about HATEOS?

"- currently the AI exposed URLs are not suitable for REST and we need to add an Apache re-write layer – would be good
if we could control the exposed AI URL and remove the re-write complexity.  There is a CR on this"

Answer: These are specific complaints about AI and REST. We need an Actional AI engineer to answer.  

On the other hand it would help us get a BA perspective on REST for our entire REST support strategy
(We have 2 mechanisms: AI and SonicConnect):
 - What are BA views on WADL? 
 - Are the WADLs under BA's control or mandated by agencies elsewhere?
 - Would they use WADL if they didn't have to? Would a URL template approach be more suitable?
 - Are there preferences between the use of path parameters versus query parameters? Do they use matrix parameters? etc.
 - Are there additional security aspects that AI is adding with REST? 
 - Is the AMS/AI visibility adequate for REST?
 - Was Sonic Connect ever discussed?(I can see why BA would want AI because of its use elsewhere)
 
"Recap of where we’ve got to with CM and MUSE
- Architecture, Light n Dark
- VM utilisation
- Hardware
- Revised plans ?" 
 
  
 "Light n Dark" 
 Ans: Great! sounds better than "Dark and Stormy"! Seriously, is this, standby vs live? Are there other shades? e.g. 
 "in the shop" - "health-performance-stress-test", etc.
 
 "Hardware"
 Ans: We should get maybe Paul Meadow's sitting in - he knows more about this e.g. 64bit vs 32bit etc etc

 
 "2. Demo of BA’s APB tool. 
What we need from Aurea to allow refinement of the automated build process"

Ans: Might need Tim De Borger, although Mitchell can probably also answer here
Q: Can we have rights to some of this code. The AI configurator(do they have a AMS one)
is I believe missing from our store - maybe AI folks can answer.

 
 DISCUSSION
"1. Performance tuning and optimization. 
- Lots of issues for me with this, want more automation, more auto tuning, sizing of CM a nightmare
- Need to be able to size more effectively for different classes of environments
- Metrics need to be more readily available without impacting management components"
 
Ans: Need Paul Meadows.
Q's: How much of this is the DXSI UC? Tuning - i.e. Rules of Thumb automatically applied? 
Return Question:  How are you performance testing? Do you think that testing(including performance testing) as a service
would interest you?

"2. Thoughts on our large scale SIP estate
- could we reduce the overall number of environments with respect to development / test etc ...
- how can we manage at this scale"
    
Return Question: How does stage-management or tools in that area fit with BA? How does stage and test management fit with BA?

"3. operational tools 
- SMC/SEM work poorly over long distances and give different answers
Ans: I need Paul Meadows/And or Bruce
    
"4.Aurea’s Support offering 
- BA feedback particularly on availability and reporting"

Ans: No comment.
 
"5. Big data & logging
- Aurea’s thoughts on opportunities / exploitation
- AMS capabilities"
Ans: Need Actional engineering to be present



"6. Aurea Resources
- Still feels that there are far too few skilled Aurea people available"
Ans: No comment.

"7. Dependency analysis
- Any suggestions on how we can automatically track run time dependencies and relate back to services in our repository"
Ans: What is their repo? We may want to consider this as a requirement gathering for our repo story in addition to providing
specific advise. For example: "impact analysis" of taking a new service? I have to assume that
BA is well aware of our esb admin deployment commands. Be interesting to know where they see short-falls.
We should include talk about Sonic/DXSI and semantic bus how for example impact analysis needs to filter back to itinerary impact.
We could give more of our experience "vision" here - e.g. the update/services experiences: try it! what is the impact? etc
narratives - this should appear in road-map/vision...

"8. Best practices and procedures wrt operating the Aurea products and tools"
Ans: No general comments, Tim D B, or Mitchell may be more suited. I may be able to answer/give opinion on specific questions. 

WE WANT TO ADD TO THE AGENDA IF NOT COVERED ELSEWHERE:
    
Dynamic Itineraries
Semantic Bus(DXSI/Sonic)
What is BA doing with Sonic/DXSI?(fyi this topic is going to come up internally)

============== END OF BA MEETING STUFF ================

Lessons from BA - TCS(Tata):
If we do hot stuff we need IP protection/patents on dynamic itinerary, semantic bus

Can we "make a deal" with TCS - e.g. you are in deep shit, we have technology(dynamic routing slip) that you need to fix it,
give us some "airline" IP or $$$.
