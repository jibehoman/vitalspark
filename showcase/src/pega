But:

Bottom-line - I do not believe they have an ESB.

Tend to "put-down" competition on WebSites  - makes you wonder whether they are out of ideas -
maybe this is just typical for enterprise solution vendors. I do not want Aurea to do this.

See neither repository, nor dynamic itinerary mentioned anywhere.

Mobile collateral is just about WebApps i.e. screen-size(no bigger vision).


"These big bang SOA projects typically deploy an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and attempt for instance to
expose as services large numbers of legacy interfaces....In other words a bottom-up approach focused
almost entirely on modern SOA plumbing. SOA architecture patterns have their place and are often essential.
But overhauling large collections of applications with a SOA stack from the bottom up, 
layer-by-layer, with no top down justification or rationale is the wrong approach"

Good ! He's not into SOA!
 
"Equating Modernization to Modern Languages, IDEs, Components, and Platforms: 
The business logic is still embedded in the code and its cryptic for the business. 
There are little or no business transparencies. 
When is the last time you saw a business stakeholder go  through Java code or use Eclipse"
 
Entirely agree.  This resonates. For the longest time we thought lowering the bar for
service developers was the thing to go after. For Java it was: POJO support without Sonic ESB
knowledge in the service code. Per Silvio, Thomas, Hub and me(now) it is the itinerary developer 
and higher up that we focus on. Setrag does not see repository and the potential we have to
separate concerns(itinerary vs service). He's gonna be broad-sided by that.
