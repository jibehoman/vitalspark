	<b>Notes:</b><br>
    Regarding messaging and imagery, there are other ways to message this, say the message is "a new enterprise application experience..."
    then things like  "Aurea Way", "Aurea Experience", "Aurea Experience Accelerator", or, Latin, "Via Aurea/Expertus Aurea" might work.

    D Kibble: &quot;A multi template design view that can represent various ‘styles’ of environment. E.g. Production, performance test, unit test, system integration, development as each is different in terms of scale and topology.&quot;
   <br><br>
   I wonder if this UI should be role-based - developer, integration manager, pre-production, production etc.
   Depending on the role, different options appear. The developer is limited may be just a single box.

    Give us your <a href="http://jira/browse/ESB-7475" target="_blank">feedback</a> on general concepts and messaging.
