1. Pegasystems(done)
2. Experience Adaptris(Esther/Tim DB reports apparently not a good experience)
3. Event Monitor(Bruce reports apparently not a big deal) 
4. Need to validate ESBDL Services paradigm - also will the field choke on this?
   Savvion adaptor for ESB may be best thing to look at
5. MOM services message mapping UC(Siraj)
6. Children's Book:The Kangaroo, the Beanstalk, the City,  and Siri(10 things you need to separate out to do SOA)
7. Sonic historical investments are about to come true("the eggs are about to hatch") everything has to be revisited.  
7.1. Cache(not a lot changes here - caching proposal of Thomas I have issues with for me because of the
extra panel in the itinerary mapping UI - sure it's optional - but it is a bit too in
your face. Cache feels like a concern in it's own right that needs another
separation story).
7.2  FS-less ESB
7.3. POJOS Again(revisited - convergence with Silvio's opinion)

8. Dynamic itinerary for BA
9. BA Cache Service !
10. What is good about Savvion - 
  - scenarios(but it's a little different because of the human pause time - tha's more
  about workflow productivity than SOA/automated BP network performance) 
  - live capture replay
  - in general human interaction(UI) and workflow (for which centralized process state is needed)
  - what is an ideal "tight" Sonic/Savvion integration look like
  - biz rules
  - UI expertize
11. We should protect our IP look at patents for "routing slip" - I'm sure thats gone, more important dynamic itinerary
and sem bus.
12. Actions SMART - Specific, Measurable, Achievable(Actionable(not Actional funny that is the message!)), Relevant, Time-bound
13. Making SC "true blue"
