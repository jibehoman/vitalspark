# List of thread names to be recognised and grouped by the
# AnalyseThreads utility.
#
# If a thread's name starts with one of the strings listed below, it
# will be matched with other threads whose names have the same prefix
# and whose normalised stacks match.
#
# In effect, the information below is used to identify the portion of
# a thread's name that it's valid to use to group threads.
#
# Where there's potential ambiguity, the longer prefix should appear
# first in this list, i.e. if the list containers MyWorkerThreads and
# MyWorkerThread, then MyWorkerThreads should appear first, otherwise
# a thread named 'MyWorkerThreads 1' would be matched against
# 'MyWorkerThread', not 'MyWorkerThreads'.
#
# The entries below can be placed in double quotes if trailing
# white-space is important (e.g. "MyThread " - these quotes are
# stripped when this file is parsed, but whitespace with in the
# quotes is preserved).
